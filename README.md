### What happens when you type www.google.com in a browser

 - 1 - Open browser type www.google.com  
- 2 - System DNS cache is checked to see if IP information was cached  
- 3 - If #2 has no info, system checks host file for address information
- 4 - If #3 has no info, system queries local DNS
- 5 - If #4 has no info, query is sent to Service Provider (SP) DNS
- 6 - If SP has no info, query sent to Root level DNS
- 7 - Root level returns the Top level DNS
- 8 - Top level DNs returns the Authoritative DNS who has the record  
- 9 - Authoritative DNS returns a DNS response with the IP address and DNS TTL information  
- 10 - The system now has the IP address and initiates a TCP connection to the server
- 11 - TCP three-way handshake takes place, TLS Secure authentication process takes place and secure connection is setup.  
- 12 - HTTP(S)/HTML process begins to return information as required
